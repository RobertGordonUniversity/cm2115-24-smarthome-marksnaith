## CM2115 smart home project - solutions

This repo will contain solutions to the weekly smart home project, with functionality added roughly a week after each class.

The aim of this repo isn't about "giving you the answers", but to allow you to compare what you've implemented with what was in mind when the lab exercises were written. However, if what you have is different that doesn't necessarily mean it's wrong - it just means it's, well, different. Many software projects will have alternative designs and subsequent implementations, each of which are suitable to address the problem.
